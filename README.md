# Optimize-identification-of-countries-requiring-NGO-focus.

Describing how I utilized SAS and SQL to streamline the processing, analysis, and visualization of socioeconomic indicators. Providing details about the techniques I employed to create precise thresholds (provided by the NGO) and advanced algorithms for categorizing nations, thereby improving the accuracy in identifying countries that require NGO focus. 
Furthermore, explaining how our efforts led to the enhancement of efficiency in identifying countries in need of NGO intervention, so that the NGO would take decisive efforts for enhancing the conditions.

Attributes are like :-

 - Child Mortality (Child_mort): This tells us how many children die before they reach the age of 5. It shows how healthy and safe living conditions are for 
 children.
- Exports: These are goods and services that a country sells to other countries. Exporting is important because it helps a country's economy grow and promotes trade with other nations.
- Health: This indicates how easy it is for people to get healthcare services. Good access to healthcare means people can stay healthy and live longer lives.
- Imports: These are goods and services that a country buys from other countries. Imports help support domestic consumption and industries by providing goods and services that might not be available locally.
- Income: Income refers to the money that individuals or households earn. It affects their living standards and how much they can buy.
- Inflation: This measures how prices in general are increasing over time. It affects how much things cost and how far your money goes when you buy goods and services.
- Life Expectancy (Life_expec): This is the average number of years a person can expect to live. It tells us about the overall health and well-being of a population.
- Total Fertility (Total_fer): This tells us how many children, on average, each woman is having. It helps us understand population growth and changes in demographics.

GDP per capita (Gdpp): This measures the economic output of a country per person. It tells us about the standard of living and overall wealth of the population.

THRESHOLDS provided by NGO for further classification are:-

- Income < 1000
- health_spending_per_capita < 2000
- child_mort > 50
- inflation > 8
- life_expec < 50
- total_fer > 2.5

IMPORTANT -SAS CODING ENVIRONMENT IS NOT PRESENT IN THE GITHUB/VISUAL STUDIO FOR EDITING AND IS ONLY POSSIBLE IN SAS SOFTWARE.
 THATS WHY CODING OUTPUT SCREENSHOTS HAS BEEN SHARED.
